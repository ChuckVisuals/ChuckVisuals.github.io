However, this leads to the problem where some animes only aired for a single day and some of the dates were missing either the day or month. In order to remedy this, we are only going to check when the anime first aired. We also will use regex to check every date and if it is missing, we will be adding in missing numbers by adding '1' for missing day and 'January' for missing month. We then converted all of the columns into datetime type so we can compare and filter it later. \n"
